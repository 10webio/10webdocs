<h3 id="fixing-performance-errors">Fixing Performance Errors</h3>

<p>After running a performance check on your WordPress site, you will be provided with a list of insights, along with their grades. These grades are scored from <strong>0 to 100%,</strong> and also, from <strong>A to F.</strong> errors and notices. Lets discuss every notice and find out how they can be resolved.</p>

<h4 id="performance">Performance</h4>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Don't scale images in the browser</code></p>

<p>Scaling images in the browser helps to make them appear nice with any screen size. However this is a common performance mistake. When the images are scaled in the browser, the website uses more CPU and hurts the performance on mobile. Also, this makes the user to download extra Kilobytes, or even Megabytes of information, and this could be avoided.</p>

<p>Instead of scaling images in the browser, you can create multiple versions of the same image and provide the appropriate one.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Do not load specific print stylesheets.</code></p>

<p>If you load a specific CSS stylesheet for printing, speed issues may occur on the page, even though the stylesheet is not used. Instead, you can include the print styles inside other CSS files by using <code class="highlighter-rouge">@media</code> query to target type print.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Avoid slowing down the critical rendering path</code></p>

<p>To begin rendering a page, browser needs to use the critical rendering path. Each file or script included inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> element will slow down the rendering of the page. To prevent the rendering from slowing down, you need to avoid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>loading JavaScript synchronously inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code>,</li>
  <li>including files from the same domain as your website (this prevents DNS lookups) and inline CSS,</li>
  <li>using server push for fast rendering and a short rendering path.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Inline CSS for faster first render</code></p>

<p>We can all agree, inline CSS can be one of the ugliest and messy things to do. However, this has changed nowadays, especially, if you wish to have quick rendering on your website pages. Use inline styling method for critical CSS, when you use HTTP/1 and HTTP/2. To put it differently, you need to prevent the site from making CSS requests, which block rendering. Additionally, you can lazy load and cache the rest of the CSS.</p>

<p>Alternatively, in case you use HTTP/2, HTTP push can be helpful, if your server supports it.</p>

<p>If most of your website users have a slow connection, it would be better to always use inline CSS. Some servers prioritize HTML content over CSS, letting the user download the HTML first. Having inline CSS will help you render the HTML and CSS content altogether.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Avoid using more than one jQuery version per page</code></p>

<p>It is highly recommended to avoid using multiple versions of jQuery on the same page.</p>

<p>This is done to prevent users from unnecessarily downloading extra data. Make sure your code is clean and the site uses only one jQuery version.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Avoid Frontend single point of failures</code></p>

<p>In case a JavaScript, CSS, or in some cases, font files cannot be fetched, the page can be stopped from loading in the browser. As a result, your website will appear to users as a blank screen.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended to avoid loading 3rd-party components synchronously inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> tag of your pages.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Always load third-party JavaScript asynchronously</code></p>

<p>To speed up the overall load time of your pages and improve user experience, use JavaScript snippets that load .js files asynchronously. This will also help to prevent blocking the initial load.</p>

<h4 id="best-practice">Best Practice</h4>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Declare a charset in your document.</code></p>

<p>Make your website read all fonts, characters, punctuations, and symbols by declaring document charset to Unicode Standard (UTF-8). It covers almost all available symbols in all languages of the world.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Declare a doctype in your document.</code></p>

<p>Always declare &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; at the beginning of your HTML document. It is not an HTML tag. It informs the web browser about the version of HTML the page is structured with.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Serve your content securely.</code></p>

<p>It is highly recommended to <a href="https://https.cio.gov/everything/">use HTTPS</a> over HTTP. This allows you to provide secure content to your users. Furthermore, HTTPS is required, in case you wish to use HTTP/2.</p>

<p>You can get a free SSL/TLC certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">this link</a>.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Serve your content using HTTP/2.</code></p>

<p>Having your website to tun with HTTP/2 together with HTTPS is the new best practice. If you do use HTTPS, which is highly recommended, you should also use HTTP/2.</p>
